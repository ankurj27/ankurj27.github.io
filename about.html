        <p>
           My journey into data analytics didn't begin with code or dashboards — it began on the factory floor.
        </p>
        <p>
            For over 12 years, I worked in manufacturing operations, quality, and process improvement. My role was always centered on solving problems, improving performance, and making systems work better. Over time, I noticed that behind every improvement and every decision, there was one constant — <strong>data</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            What started as curiosity slowly became a strong interest.
        </p>
        <p> 
            I made a conscious and strategic decision to shift into data analytics — not because something went wrong, but because this direction felt right. I invested time in learning Power BI, SQL, Python, Tableau, built hands-on projects across multiple domains, and earned the Microsoft Certified Data Analyst Associate (PL-300) certification.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            Today, I bring a blend of industry experience and analytical thinking. I enjoy simplifying complex information, designing clean and user-friendly dashboards, and helping teams understand what's happening, why it's happening, and what actions they can take next.
        </div>
        <p>
            I strongly believe learning never stops — and transitioning into analytics has only made that belief stronger. I look forward to continuing this journey, growing with every project, and contributing wherever data can make a difference.
